# cheffplate
:beginner: Front End™ compiler boilerplate with Webpack + React+Redux + Karma + Stylus + PostCSS and Custom architecture to build custom apps from zero.

ps. Keep in mind: feel free to create an issue, contribute and discuss about it after all I created this boilerplate because of my preference on using it and its technologies applied.

### Known Issues
If you're not able to run ```npm run dev``` or even ```npm run build``` just change variable named "$npm_package_config_envs_dev" to "%npm_package_config_envs_dev%"
