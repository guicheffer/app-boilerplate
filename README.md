# cheffplate
:beginner: Front End™ compiler boilerplate with Webpack + React+Redux + Stylus (w/ flexbox-grid) + Karma and Custom architecture to build custom apps from zero.

ps. Keep in mind: feel free to create an issue, contribute and discuss about it after all I created this boilerplate because of my preference on using it and its technologies applied.

Heroku
------
Here we added heroku-prebuild for installing new dev dependencies but you can do it also via config on heroku, here is what you want:
`heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`

...enjoy using cheffplate :smile:

### Known Issues
If you're not able to run ```npm run dev``` or even ```npm run build``` just change variable named _"$>%"_ `$npm_package_config_envs_dev` to `%npm_package_config_envs_dev%`
