:beginner: Webpack + React+Redux + Karma + Stylus + PostCSS + Custom architecture and compiler boilerplate way to build custom applications from zero.

ps. Keep in mind: feel free to create an issue, contribute and discuss about it after all I created this boilerplate because of my preference on using it and its technologies applied.
